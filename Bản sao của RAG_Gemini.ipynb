It works by assigning a unique number to each resource (in this case, forks), and establishing a rule that each process must acquire resources in ascending order of their number.  For example, a philosopher would pick up the lower-numbered fork first and then the higher-numbered one. This prevents circular dependencies that lead to deadlocks. However, this approach isn't perfect. It can be inefficient because a process might need to release already-acquired resources to get a lower-numbered one, and it's not fair because a slow process might be perpetually blocked by faster ones.\n","\n"]}],"source":["db=load_chroma_collection(path=\"/content/new_database\", #replace with path of your persistent directory\n","                          name=\"new_collection\") #replace with the collection name\n","\n","answer = generate_answer(db,query=\"What is Resource Hierarchy Solution?\")\n","print(answer)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mDFchK_-JIK0"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1tQ9COmGYV22nUuXuue3FNscuM395Uc83","timestamp":1741290128557}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
